## A Monero wallet interface

This is a work in progress, but since the project is quite large, I felt like sharing that progress. I've been documenting my work in Notion, which has quickly grown to be my favourite application for general management.

The workspace is public. If you'd like to have a look, head on over to [notion.so/mwiw](https://www.notion.so/mwiw/Management-ecee41a3d26c49e7aeef2c543ac6d821). If you'd like to comment, log in with your account.

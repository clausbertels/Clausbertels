# An interesting case of brand identity.

What we’re talking about here is just a name and a logo.

Last month I was finishing up my bachelor’s thesis. I designed an appliance that produces fresh nut milk. This alternative milk can then be used in coffee- or alcohol-based beverages. The end result is a product concept that’s feasible for production and possesses features in line with the product strategy.

Since this machine would most commonly be found next to high-end espresso machines, I found it fitting for a commercial product like this to, in similar fashion, have a name and logo (pictured above). After a short brainstorm I settled on the name Nuletta. I liked the name because it sounded somewhat Italian and could be roughly translated as ‘new milk’. Many people seemed to recognize something else, though.

Nutella is a world famous brand of delicious hazelnut spread. I completely agree on the likeness between both names. They have all of the same letters and but two consonants are switched. However, the most interesting remark I frequently got was that I didn’t only copy the name, I also copied Nutella’s style of branding. I found this funny because, to me, my logo looks nothing like theirs. Yet, people were so convinced I had to write about it.

This tells me two things. Firstly, how people perceive brands may have much more to do with the product itself than I presumed. I wonder if I can find more examples where there's a dissonance between brand and branding. Secondly, I guess that in their minds they linked my logo’s handcrafted and smooth style to Nutella’s creaminess and viscosity. I count that as a success.

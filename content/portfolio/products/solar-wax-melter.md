## A product concept for The Bee Factory

In many third world countries, farmers don't have access to the technology we've grown accustomed to in the west. A solar wax melter is a low-tech product that facilitates the separation of beeswax, honey and organic waste. This leftover mixture is collected by farmers in sunny Jimma, Ethiopia. 

The wax melter features a heating chamber which relies on the same principle as greenhouses do. Organic waste sticks to the textured stainless steel plate while wax and honey melt into a container at the bottom of the slope (not pictured). The wax floats on top and can be picked off by hand. Both the wax and honey are post-processed to create the very pure end products.

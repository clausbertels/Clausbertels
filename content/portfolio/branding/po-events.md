##By students, for students.

*%meta.title%* is an undertaking founded by the master students Product Development at the University of Antwerp, Belgium. Their goal is to provide all students, and  occasionally professors and alumni, within their faculty with events to enrich their years at the school. Types of these events range from club parties to networking nights or "cheap-lunch" days.

# %meta.title%

##By students, for students.

*%meta.title%* is a non-profit undertaking founded by the masters' students of Product Development at the University of Antwerp, Belgium. Their goal is to provide all students, and occasionally professors and alumni, within their faculty, with events to enrich their years at the school. The types of these events range from club parties to networking nights and "cheap-lunch" days.

As lead of print and digital media, I thought the old logo could use a refresh.

"PO" is the abbreviated form of *Product Ontwikkeling*, dutch for "product development". It's an initialism that gets very frequent use when talking about the studies. This is why I think the wordmark is a great idea. But the execution felt a little generic. It lacks character and isn't very memorable.

We envisioned a logo that could double as a label. It had to be something that felt like it could be easily used as an ink stamp or a sticker to depict the quality of the event. It had to be visible from a distance to catch your eye on promotional posters and social media pictures.

After a couple of iterations we settled on a blocky, fat design.

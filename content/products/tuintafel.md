## A thin frame and a glass top

I originally designed this table as a budget dining table for our apartment. It used to have a birch plywood top. After moving I didn't want to waste the frame, so I decided to make it into an outdoor table for the summer. I put two coats of weather- and rustproof black paint on the 25 mm square steel legs. An unused tinted glass sheet we had lying around proved to be a perfect top.

I especially enjoy how it minimally impacts its environment due to, not only the thin materials, but also the reflection of the trees and sky in the glass top.

## Fresh nut milk in any café

This machine converts your almonds or hazelnuts to fresh nut milk, ready to use in your café's beverages. The milk is chilled and frequently stirred to preserve quality and improve foamability.

Nuletta showcases the process and adds to the customer's experience of enjoying a drink in your bar.

Additionally, Nuletta is easy to clean. All parts the milk comes in contact with are removable and dishwasher-safe. With a thorough rinse under hot water all parts are ready for reassembly.

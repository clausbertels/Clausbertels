## Fresh nut milk in any café

This machine converts your almonds or hazelnuts into fresh nut milk, ready to use in your café's beverages. The milk is chilled and frequently stirred to preserve quality and improve foamability.

Nuletta showcases the process and adds to the customer's experience of enjoying a drink in your bar.

Additionally, Nuletta is easy to clean. All parts the milk touches are removable and dishwasher-safe. After a thorough rinse under hot water all parts are ready for reassemby.

## Notes

*At the start of the design process, zooming out is vital. While I was trying to find an angle at which to tackle the problem, I should have reframed the problem itself earlier.*

The client is a vegan coffeehouse (that sells pies online). In the original brief, they explained there was a need for a better nut milk making machine than the one they currently use. Their process, as described by them, looked something like this:

<small>soak nuts → pour them in the machine with water → collect milk in large bucket → bottle the milk</small>

I lazily assumed that the bottled milk was the end product. So let's take this process, analyze it and then figure out where to improve, right? I spent a week doing exactly that before a colleague's innocent comment made me realize I didn't have the full picture. What happens to the bottles? After an enlightening interview with the store owners I gained more details about and insight into the full process.

<small>soak nuts → blend ingredients → pour them in the machine → collect milk in large bucket → bottle the milk → refridgerate large stock → refridgerate small stock near bar → use small stock to foam milk in a pitcher and use in drinks</small>

Now that the bar is part of the context, our brainstorm suddenly becomes a lot more interesting. This is the point where I decided on some sort of machine that lives on het aanrecht that delivers fresh nut milk right in the barista's pitcher.

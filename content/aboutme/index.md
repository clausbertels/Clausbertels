# Hello

My name is Claus Bertels. I'm a student in **Product Development** at the University of Antwerp. These studies are industrially focused, but my love for design carries over to other fields. Second to commercial, **physical products**, I like working on **digital** and **d.i.y. design** projects. 

When I'm not designing, you might find me swimming, gaming, playing the drums, discovering great new music or generally learning about new exciting topics.

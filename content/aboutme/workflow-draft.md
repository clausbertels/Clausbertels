# Hello

## My name is Claus Bertels.

I recently graduated in Product Development at the University of Antwerp. My schooling may be industrially focused, but my love for design carries over to other fields. Second to consumer and industrial products, I like working on digital and d.i.y. design projects. 

When I'm not designing, you might find me doing laps in the pool, playing the drums, discovering great new music or generally learning about new exciting topics. 

## Contact

I love meeting new people and hearing about your projects. <br />Try messaging [my inbox](mailto:claus.bertels@gmail.com), [my Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/clausbertels/), or [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/clausbertels).
